## Features
Users can enter a city name and view the current weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the weather conditions.

In addition to current weather data, users can see a 5-day weather forecast that includes date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

The application stores a list of recent searches, and users can click on a previous search to quickly retrieve the weather data for that city.
